(just worried about her and want to make sure i understand everything well.)\n\n- if antibiotics are unwarranted, does this mean i should stop the antibiotic treatment that was given to mora yesterday? \n\n- under the flutd description it says: “a urine culture and sensitivity panel must be performed to identify the bacteria and see which antibiotics it is sensitive to.” — is this refering to utis or flutd? does mora need to come in to do this?\n\n- for the buprenorphine and prazosin, do i continue those as instructed or for a longer period?\n\n- how can i avoid the crystals forming into stones and/or monitor that? is hydration the only prevention?\n\n- is flutd chronic? how often can flare ups occur? what are the stressors? \n\n- my apartment is quite small (350 sq ft). would it be okay for us to just have one litter box for her?\n\n- we use world’s best clumping litter (unscented)- is this an okay litter or would you recommend a specific litter for cats with flutd? \n\n- what soap do you recommend for cleaning her litter box? \n\n- how often and how much should mora be urinating? just to make sure i can identify when she is under-urinating.\n\ncan i make an appointment to go to the fort greene location on monday the 22nd of march in the afternoon? this would be at the 5 week mark for her follow-up urine test.\n\nthank you so much for bearing with me through all the questions! i really hope she recovers soon and will keep you all updated. i appreciate all the work you do to keep mora healthy and let me know if there’s anything additional i can do.\n\nall the best,\nandrea"

              "hi dr. grossman,\n\nthank you so much for the update. i actually got a cat fountain yesterday as i was reading up on how dehydration can cause utis and bladder issues, but mora hasn’t paid much attention to it, unfortunately. do you have any advice on this? currently i keep both the fountain and an additional fresh water bowl out at all times. i will also switch to just canned food and add water to it as well. mora’s behavior has already improved and she seems to be in less pain, hopefully this will continue throughout the week, and i will continue monitoring her urine and behavior. today she did have some blood in her urine, and she did go to the litter box once and i noticed she was not able to urinate. \n\ni was also hoping to clarify some questions that i had. i hope that’s okay! (just worried about her and want to make sure i understand everything well.)\n\n- if antibiotics are unwarranted, does this mean i should stop the antibiotic treatment that was given to mora yesterday? \n\n- under the flutd description it says: “a urine culture and sensitivity panel must be performed to identify the bacteria and see which antibiotics it is sensitive to.” — is this refering to utis or flutd? does mora need to come in to do this?\n\n- for the buprenorphine and prazosin, do i continue those as instructed or for a longer period?\n\n- how can i avoid the crystals forming into stones and/or monitor that? is hydration the only prevention?\n\n- is flutd chronic? how often can flare ups occur? what are the stressors? \n\n- my apartment is quite small (350 sq ft). would it be okay for us to just have one litter box for her?\n\n- we use world’s best clumping litter (unscented)- is this an okay litter or would you recommend a specific litter for cats with flutd? \n\n- what soap do you recommend for cleaning her litter box? \n\n- how often and how much should mora be urinating? just to make sure i can identify when she is under-urinating.\n\ncan i make an appointment to go to the fort greene location on monday the 22nd of march in the afternoon? this would be at the 5 week mark for her follow-up urine test.\n\nthank you so much for bearing with me through all the questions! i really hope she recovers soon and will keep you all updated. i appreciate all the work you do to keep mora healthy and let me know if there’s anything additional i can do.\n\nall the best,\nandrea",

              "hi,\ni wanted to reach out because mora reacted really badly to the compounded antibiotics that arrived earlier tonight, which dr, murphy was able to prescribe this afternoon. i gave mora only about a third of the dose and she immediately vomited all the food she had eaten and started foaming (a lot) from her mouth, and running all over the house, freaking out and not letting me get near her. this has never happened before, not with any of the other medicines. i called the office when this happened but it was closed. i then called the pharmacy that compounded and sold me the medicine and they said a pharmacist would get it touch with me. however, they did not. \ni was hoping to talk one of the doctors that has treated mora about how to move forward with her antibiotic treatment. after some quick research, it seems that this specific antibiotic (trimeth / sulfamethox) has a known history of causing severe reactions when administered, especially in liquid form -- with many cats having repeated foaming incidents. mora reacted really violently to the medication. so much so, that i really doubt she'll be able to continue on it (in this form at least). in my research, i also found it's often recommended this antibiotic be given in pill form. i was surprised i was not warned of these side effects. i would like to explore other options as it doesn't seem like this would work. however, i'd like the treatment options more clearly explained to me over the phone, to avoid any further incidents and unexpected side effects. \nthanks in advance,\nandrea"
